/**
 * Algorithm
 *
 * The divide-and-conquer strategy is used in quicksort. Below the recursion
 * step is described: Choose a pivot value. We take the value of the middle
 * element as pivot value, but it can be any value, which is in range of sorted
 * values, even if it doesn't present in the array. Partition. Rearrange
 * elements in such a way, that all elements which are lesser than the pivot go
 * to the left part of the array and all elements greater than the pivot, go to
 * the right part of the array. Values equal to the pivot can stay in any part
 * of the array. Notice, that array may be divided in non-equal parts. Sort both
 * parts. Apply quicksort algorithm recursively to the left and the right parts.
 * Partition algorithm in detail
 *
 * There are two indices i and j and at the very beginning of the partition
 * algorithm i points to the first element in the array and j points to the last
 * one. Then algorithm moves i forward, until an element with value greater or
 * equal to the pivot is found. Index j is moved backward, until an element with
 * value lesser or equal to the pivot is found. If i â‰¤ j then they are swapped
 * and i steps to the next position (i + 1), j steps to the previous one (j -
 * 1). Algorithm stops, when i becomes greater than j.
 *
 * After partition, all values before i-th element are less or equal than the
 * pivot and all values after j-th element are greater or equal to the pivot.
